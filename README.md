# Less F3
A small minecraft mod which adds the filtered F3 mode with its own keybind. So it's for you if you don't want to always see your system information and a bunch of unnesessary information.  
Currently no filter customisation, but the work is in progress. It is my first mod, so I still learn how to make gui
